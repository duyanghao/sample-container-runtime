sample-container-runtime
========================

This is a simple container-runtime implemented for learning purposes.

**Stay tuned as this evolves!**

## Introduction to container technology

In general, a container is lightweight virtualization that, among others, allows to:
* run a process in separate, isolated sandbox (environment)
* have a separate filesystem mounted to a container
* isolate a container from the security perspective (allow/disallow system calls)
* limit the privileges of the process run in a container
* limit resources allocated for a container

Containers are based on following concepts:

* `namespaces` - Linux (or kernel) namespaces allows to create a new logical instances of an operating system's subsystems. Other definition says that "Linux namespace is a scoped view of your underlying Linux system".
As a result, the new instances are isolated from the OS they are running on and from the instances running in other namespaces.
There are following namespaces in Linux:
  * **UTS namespace** is about isolating hostnames. This namespace allows to set a different hostname for a container.
  * **MNT namespace** allows to mount a separate file system for a container.
  * **PID namespace** gives a container an isolated view on currently running Linux processes. As a result, a container will see only its own processes (processes of host OS will not be visible).
  * **IPC namespace** isolates an inter-process communication. It prevents processes in different namespaces from establishing a shared memory to communicate with each other.
  * **USER namespace** allows to create a separate, (usually) privileged user (technically it's a logical mapping of a user created in host OS, I will explain it later) within the namespace. Users configured in a host OS are not visible from a container.
  * **NET namespace** creates a logical instance of a Linux network stack. A container has its own list of network interfaces, routing table and iptables rules.
* `cgroups` and `setrlimit` - these both mechanisms are used to limit usage of resources (e.g. memory, disk I/O, CPU time) for a container.
* `root capabilities` - capabilities limits the privileges of root user of container.
* `Pivot_root` - the mechanism to change the root file system for a container.

Technically, a container is just a separate process, which is isolated from the host OS by using the concept of Linux namespaces.
Moreover, resources and privileges of this process are limited. All together creates the abstraction of a container.

## UTS namespace isolation

In case of UTS namespace it's all about passing a CLONE_NEWUTS to clone() function and invoking syscall.Sethostname() from within a child process.

The result can be tested by using hostname command from the container and outside the container:

```bash
# inside of container
$ ./build/pkg/cmd/sample-container-runtime/sample-container-runtime /bin/bash rootdir
[root@uvNfXXCGtm sample-container-runtime]# hostname
uvNfXXCGtm
[root@uvNfXXCGtm sample-container-runtime]# exit
exit
INFO[0002] container exit normally
# outside of container
$ hostname
vm-xxx
```

## MNT namespace isolation

Isolating container in the MNT namespace is a little bit more complex. First of all, we need to provide a new filesystem for the container. I recommend to use busybox root filesystem:

```bash
$ mkdir assets/busybox
$ tar -xf busybox.tar -C assets/busybox
```

We will use busybox as a mount directory for the container.

In a child process the PivotRoot() function is called. This function is responsible for mounting <rootfs-dir> as a root filesystem for the container. In particular, it does following operations:

1. remounts current root filesystem with MS_PRIVATE
2. binds mount new root to itself
3. creates temporary directory, where the old root will be stored
4. [pivots root (swaps the mount at `/` with another (the `<rootfs-dir>` in this case).](https://lwn.net/Articles/689856/)
   pivot_root() changes the root directory and the current working
   directory of each process or thread in the same mount namespace to
   new_root if they point to the old root directory.  (See also NOTES.)
   On the other hand, pivot_root() does not change the caller's current
   working directory (unless it is on the old root directory), and thus
   it should be followed by a chdir("/") call.
   
   The following restrictions apply:
   -  new_root and put_old must be directories.
    
   -  new_root and put_old must not be on the same mount as the current
      root.

   -  put_old must be at or underneath new_root; that is, adding some
      nonnegative number of "/.." prefixes to the pathname pointed to by
      put_old must yield the same directory as new_root.

   -  new_root must be a path to a mount point, but can't be "/".  A
      path that is not already a mount point can be converted into one
      by bind mounting the path onto itself.

   -  The propagation type of the parent mount of new_root and the
      parent mount of the current root directory must not be MS_SHARED;
      similarly, if put_old is an existing mount point, its propagation
      type must not be MS_SHARED.  These restrictions ensure that
      pivot_root() never propagates any changes to another mount
      namespace.

   -  The current root directory must be a mount point.       
5. ensures current working directory is set to new root(os.Chdir("/"))
6. umounts and removes the old root

The implementation can be tested using `mount` command. From within the container it should show no mounts.

```bash
$ ./build/pkg/cmd/sample-container-runtime/sample-container-runtime /bin/sh assets/busybox
/ # env
SHLVL=1
PWD=/
/ # mount
mount: no /proc/mounts
/ # ls
bin    dev    etc    home   lib    lib64  root   tmp    usr    var
/ # hostname
bdUcLVkPYF
/ # exit
INFO[0011] container exit normally
```
